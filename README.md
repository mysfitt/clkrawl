Craigslist Search Module for Perl with accompanying search script


Search the Craigslist website for stuff. Note that this is done via
a scraper and prone to breakage if CL feels like changing things.

There is no official API unfortunately :(

Check in the bin/ directory for script called clkrawl.pl that you can
copy to any bin directory in your path after installing the module.

Credit for the Original version of this Module goes to Martin Thurn <mthurn@cpan.org>
